Standardized Open-Data (JSON API) for Municipalities and Regions

While most European Parlaments already comply to the EU directive of sharing it's data through API's, many regions/counties and municipalities struggle to comply. The non-profit iGov.DirectÂ® Foundation has therefor initiated a project, piloting in Sweden, to try to help setting a standardized API structure for all interested parties.
